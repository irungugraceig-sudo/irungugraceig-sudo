# 🌌 Hey, I'm Grace

**I build networks that connect continents. Now I'm building tools that predict the future.**

## 🌍 From Kenya to Boston: The Journey

I spent seven years laying fiber optic cables across Africa's lakes and oceans. I secured **$102M** to connect countries. I dove 1,400 meters below Lake Tanganyika where no one had surveyed before. I led teams across 10+ countries, turning impossible infrastructure projects into reality.

But here's the thing, I didn't just want to build the pipes. **I wanted to understand what flows through them.**

So I came to Northeastern University. MS in Telecommunication Networks.Not to abandon infrastructure, but to answer a question that kept me up at night:

**What happens when communication evolves from into immersive spaces?**

## 🔮 What I'm Building Now

### [GlitchWitch](https://github.com/irungugraceig-sudo/Glitchwitch) - My Answer to That Question

Traditional network tools measure "is the connection fast?" 

But in VR? The wrong question. 

**The right question:** "Will this network make people sick?"

GlitchWitch doesn't just monitor networks—it predicts when your VR meeting will glitch before you feel nauseous. It reads Wireshark captures like tea leaves, telling you exactly when and why immersion breaks.

Because I learned something laying cables: **infrastructure isn't about bandwidth. It's about human experience.**

## 🚀 What Else I've Built

**Academic Projects** (because you have to prove you can do the fundamentals):
- Multi-area OSPF connecting 5 global offices
- Enterprise security with SSH, port security, EtherChannel  
- Linux infrastructure with DNS, DHCP, web services
- Optical transport networks (SONET/OTN)
- VLSM subnetting and static routing

**Real-World Impact** (because theory without practice is just talk):
- Submarine cable deployments across East/Central Africa
- $102M+ in infrastructure financing secured
- International project management across multiple countries
- First-ever deep-lake fiber optic route survey

## 💡 What I Believe

**Networks aren't cables and routers.** They're invisible highways carrying human connection.

When I was managing submarine cable projects, I wasn't thinking "bits per second." I was thinking: "This fiber will let a student in Tanzania access the same opportunities as someone in Boston."

Now I'm researching XR networks with the same mindset: **How do we build infrastructure that makes the impossible feel natural?**

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

Summer 2026 internships where I can:
- Research emerging communication technologies
- Build tools that don't exist yet
- Work at the intersection of infrastructure and innovation
- Learn from people who think differently

**Companies I'm watching:** Meta Reality Labs, Nokia Bell Labs, Google Research, Microsoft Mixed Reality
